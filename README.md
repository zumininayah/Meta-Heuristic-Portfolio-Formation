# Meta-Heuristic Portfolio Formation Through Cluster Analysis: Comparison with Mean Variance in Telecommuncation, Banking, And Oil And Gas Stocks
This final project aimed to form an optimal investment portfolio by applying clustering and metaheuristic optimization techniques to stocks in Indonesia's telecommunication, banking, and oil & gas sectors. Daily closing price data from nine companies (e.g., TLKM, ISAT, BBCA, PGAS) over a one-year period (November 2023 – November 2024) were analyzed using three clustering methods: K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), based on return and volatility characteristics.

After determining the optimal number of clusters, one stock with the highest average return from each cluster was selected to form a diversified portfolio. Optimization of portfolio weights was then performed using three metaheuristic algorithms—Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)—alongside the conventional Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) method. Portfolio performance was evaluated based on annual return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

The results showed that PSO and MVO provided the best performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Simulation of short-term investment using IDR 1 billion capital confirmed that PSO and MVO portfolios delivered higher and more stable profits compared to the others. This project demonstrates how a combination of unsupervised learning and metaheuristic optimization can enhance investment decision-making and portfolio management.
